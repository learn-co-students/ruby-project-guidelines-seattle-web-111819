# Mod 1 Project - Josh Phelps

1. Fork and clone the project from github
2. To run the program enter ruby bin/run.rb in the console
3. You can login as an artist with a valid user name or create a new artist user
      - to find already created artists, look in the seed file for artist usernames and passwords
      - example: Artist "Dirty Rugs" has username: dirty_rugs and password: p@ssword
4. You can

      # as an Artist
      - create events 
      - update event venue for future event
      - update account setting (password, username, etc.)
      - looks up past, future, and all events 
      - look up your events by venue 
      - delete event  

      # as a fan
      - view all venues
      - view all artists
      - view all events by artist
      - view all events by venue 

5. 
      - I didn't have time to make a login for venues so there is no way to make a venue in the program
      - Therefore you can currently only make new events as an artist with existing venues 

# Conclusion 
If I could do this again. I would set it up much differently. I eneded up repeating code for a lot of methods. That said, it was a fun first project and I learned a lot.
